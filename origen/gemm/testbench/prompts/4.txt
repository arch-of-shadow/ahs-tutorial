Please modify the GEMM testbench to write matrices A and B to hex files:
- Matrix A to "init_a.hex", initialized with i + k
- Matrix B to "init_b.hex", initialized with k + j
- Each 32-bit value should be written in hex format, one per line

The hex files will be used by the GEMM kernel for matrix initialization.
