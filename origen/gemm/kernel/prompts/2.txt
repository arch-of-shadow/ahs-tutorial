There are a few issues that require correction.
Calculation in READ State: The READ state is currently performing calculations. This is incorrect. The READ state should be solely dedicated to reading data from ram_a and ram_b. The actual matrix multiplication computations should be performed exclusively within the COMPUTE state.
Updating valid in always_comb: The valid signal, which is a registered output, is being modified in the always_comb block. This is not permissible in SystemVerilog. Registered outputs should only be updated within an always_ff block, synchronized to the clock edge.
State Transition Logic: The state transition logic appears to have an issue. The transition from READ should go directly to COMPUTE after reading the necessary data. Then COMPUTE state should check if the accumulation for the current output element is finished (i.e., k == NK - 1). If it is not finished it should go back to READ state to fetch the next pair of elements. If the accumulation is finished, then it should go to the OUTPUT state.
