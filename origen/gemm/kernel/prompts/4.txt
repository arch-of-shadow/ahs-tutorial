You've made progress on the gemm_kernel, but there are still a few errors that need fixing:
Resetting k in COMPUTE: In the COMPUTE state, when k reaches NK - 1, you need to reset k to 0.
if (k < NK - 1) begin
    k <= k + 1;
end else begin
    k <= 0;
end

Missing Transition from COMPUTE to READ: In the COMPUTE state within always_comb block, you need to transition back to the READ state if k is still less than NK -1 to read the next set of values from memory.
if (k == NK - 1) begin
    next_state = OUTPUT;
end else begin
    next_state = READ;
end

Incorrect Transition from OUTPUT: The transition logic from the OUTPUT state is not quite right. It should transition to READ directly instead of waiting for valid to be high.
OUTPUT: begin
if (i == NI - 1 && j == NJ - 1) begin
next_state = IDLE;
end else begin
next_state = READ; 
end
